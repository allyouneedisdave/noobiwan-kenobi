Learning git, learning code, learning life.

Adding text now to my readme file so I can track the changes and figure out just what the sweet baby Jesus Christ i'm doing.


I have now cloned this repository to my C:\Users\David Lynam\noobiwan-kenobi, this is the next edit to this file that I will attempt to push to the github repository by using git bash.

I have now added even more text, i'll merge this with the master but leave the branch in tact.

Another change to test syncing. attempting now to push an old copy from local rep.
